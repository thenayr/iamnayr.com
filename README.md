This is the source code for my personal website built on the Jekyll platform.  It uses the [Mina](https://github.com/nadarei/mina) gem to deploy to production server in just under 4 seconds.

I've gone with [Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com) for hosting as it is very performant for the cost, $5.

## Crunchbang Linux is awesome, or why I switched to Linux as my every-day OS

##Crunchbang Linux on a Lenovo X120e
It's been a long time coming, but I've finally made the switch to a linux based distro for my every day outside-work computing.  The more I use OS X on a daily basis for both sysadmin and ops related tasks, along with more simplistic things like managing this blog (it runs on Jekyll), the more I start to despise just how complicated things as simple as installing dependencies tends to be.  I'm going to give a birds-eye view into what made me commit to making the change to Linux, pitfalls along the way and how I ended up making the decisioin to go with Crunchbang Linux.

##Why I made the change to Linux

Package and dependency management on OS X sucks.  Let's take Imagemagick for example.  On a fully updated install of OS X Mountain Lion, you can waste an entire afternoon trying to get it running properly.   You'll probably end up installing two or three hefty "package managers" (see Homebrew or Macports, and don't even think about running those side-by-side), a good hour reading through hacks on Stack Overflow and if you're lucky you'll end up with a semi-working install along with a ton of extra cruft left around your system that you aren't even aware of.  That isn't to say that these things aren't evolving, Homebrew has come a long way and is a step in the right direction for developers on the OS X platform, but try any self respected Unix distro and you'll soon find yourself shudder at the thought of a repo-less OS. Typically every new incremental version of OS X tends to break whatever was working before.

I've always had a hidden fetish for Unix based distros, often finding myself downloading the latest edge release of Ubuntu only to install it and get lost in a maze of driver incompatibilities and cross-platform confusion and inexperience with 'the linux way of things'. It was mostly a love-hate relationship. The lack of games used to be a turn-off for me as well, although lately I find myself less and less concerned about that, not to mention steam has recently been ported to linux as well. 

The latest version of Ubuntu (12.10 as of this post), in fact, was the first time a unix install on one of my machines ran flawlessly out of the box.  Wifi worked perfectly, audio, graphics, everything that seem to be broken and impossible to fix in the past was working great.  It's clear that Canonical is a real contender now.  While this is great for Linux in general, I think it also partially turned me off to the Ubuntu platform. As exciting as it was to have a Linux install working perfectly, it just felt too...familiar.  The whole reason I was drawn to the Unix platform was for flexibility and control, raw keyboard crunching power over what happens on screen (and off), things that Ubuntu seemed to want to mask from me.  It makes sense.  People don't want complicated computers.  Computers are supposed to be easy, smart, smarter than you...Why should I have to tell my computer where to put a window when I click on a program, or where to install a package to?  It definitely takes a certain type of personality. For Ubuntu to compete with the top-dogs, it has to be familiar and simple.  

Coming from a fairly extensive background of strictly OS X / Windows computers, making the switch outright to a Unix distro can be fairly daughnting.  Why isn't this program installing when I click on it?  Where the hell are my programs stored?  Why does nothing happen when I click on my desktop?  These are questions you will probably find yourself asking, as I did.   Unfortunately, there really isn't a 'right' answer to doing most things on a Linux machine.  Certainly there are best practices to be followed and having experience with managing a servers already on a Unix platform will definitely come in handy. It is important to stay open-minded throughout the process.  It can be incredibly frustrating to hit a hotkey combination that you are absolutely sure will copy selected text into your clipboard only to have it switch to a new window or open some unexpected menu item.  Unix is incredible flexible, if you are absolutely certain that cmd+c is the only key combination that should copy text to your clipboard, then there is almost certainly a way to do so.

I see it almost as a technological evolution.  One can only stay on one closed platform for so long before you start to grow beyond its boundries.  Ubuntu is an excellent alternative for a linux beginner ready to get his feet wet with a new OS, but I wanted something more...

Enter Crunchbang Linux, arguably the most light-weight, customizable and out of the box good-looking linux distribution I could find.  Considering that I was looking to run linux on what one might consider an outdated machine, a Lenovo X120e netbook, this seemed like a match made in heaven.  Crunchbang, like Ubuntu, is a Debian based linux distribution.  This means flexibility, widely supported drivers and extremely robust package management.  Perfect, now we're on the right track!

##Up and running with Crunchbang
After installing Crunchbang you are given the opportunity to run an initial setup script which basically asks you a variety of yes/no questions all the while installing packages it thinks might be useful to you.  This is an excellent resource for someone whom might be less then familiar with all the unix platform has to offer.  I found myself installing a fair amount of packages through the setup script.  I think it's a rather clever way to help mitigate some of the pains of installing each package manually while also keeping the base install very lightweight for power users.

You are soon greeted with an aesthetically pleasing, minimalist desktop accented with a nice [conky](http://conky.sourceforge.net/) widget offering advice for accessing some of the openbox powered hotkeys and a few system-level statistics.  Learn to love these hotkeys.  They are the backbone of the Crunchbang / openbox combination and can be customized as you please. [Openbox](http://openbox.org/) is an extremely lightweight window manager installed in vanilla Crunchbang. Prior to Crunchbang I had only a vague notion of exactly what a window manager really was (aside from the obvious implications).  The shortest description is a program that manages the windows visible to the end user, but it's slightly more involved than that.  Window managers come in several different flavors including tiling window managers and floating window managers.  Most people are familiar with the floating style window manager.  This is essentially exactly what you get with every OS nowadays.  "Floating" windows are just that, windows that can float free-form across the desktop.  Usually opening a new window stacks it on top of the any previously opened window.  Users can usually move them wherever they please as well as minimize and maximize them.  Openbox is a floating window manager.  It's agreat entry point for someone new to open source window managers. Aside from simply managing what happens when you open a new window, Openbox is also responsible for all of the hotkeys  

Once you begin to get an understand of all the individual bits and pieces that all work together to create the desktop experience, you can start to customize each piece to fit your needs exactly.  That's the true beauty of a flexible unix system, if you don't like the way something works, you can change it and make it your own.

# Introduction to Cinder - Preface
This post is to be the first of a series of tutorials to teach (both myself) and newcomers how to create simple applications with the wonderful [Cinder](http://libcinder.org) framework.  The basis of these tutorials is the fantastic book [The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/) written by Daniel Shiffman. Daniel's book was my first experience with "creative coding", or what I would describe as writing code for the purpose of creating something interactive, visually appealing, unusual and sometimes completely unexpected. That isn't to say that coding in and of itself isn't a creative act, just that it's much more typically done to solve a specific issue, or guide a user through a series of tasks that lead to an expected end result. I highly recommend picking up a copy of the book or at least browsing through the free online edition.  It uses the Java based [Processing](http://processing.org) framework (also superb) to design simulations of naturally occuring systems in the physical world.

# Why I'm writing these tutorials
The premise of this series of tutorials is both to introduce newcomers to the Cinder C++ framework as well as to enhance my own learning process and hopefully guide other people through some of the problems that I encountered as a first-time C++ user. Being that Cinder is written in C++, it can be much more daunting to simply pickup and go, whereas a framework like Processing that comes with a built-in IDE and abstracts away most of the complex stuff would be far less intimidating.  C++ certainly isn't for everyone, if you've never used a statically typed, compiled language before, it can be tough to simply jump in. My biggest goal is to get you to set aside those fears for the time being and just start creating.  If you're anything like me, you'll find that having so much control over things like memory usage can be fun and even empowering.  The benefits of using a language like C++ are very clear when it comes to raw speed and graphics processing power. 

# What is Cinder?
I'm going to keep this section as brief as possible, if you are reading this series, more likely than not you already know what Cinder is, have it installed and have run at least one of the samples.  If not, you should stop reading and at least get as far as that first.  Go look at the [Cinder docs](http://libcinder.org/docs/v0.8.5/) they are fairly straightforward and robust enough to get you started.

#Prerequisites
All of these tutorials have been created using the latest available version of Cinder v0.8.5 on a MacBook Air running 10.8.4.  If you are running the Windows version of Cinder, I would assume these tutorials would still be pretty useful, although you probably won't find the screenshots of Xcode and OSX specific stuff of any use.  If someone would like to contribute Visual Studio specific code samples or screenshots etc, I would happily add them where necessary.

# A last word
This isn't meant to be a definitive guide to Cinder nor a comprehensive guide to C++, however it should serve as a useful introduction to both.  C++ is a very complex language with extensive best practices that I won't pretend to understand, but that's OK.  It's still not terribly hard to create fun and exciting graphics driven programs that perform wonderfully. 

# Let's begin
Without further ado, let's proceed forward to [tutorial 1]()

##Blazing fast Jekyll blog deploys using Mina
For the latest iteration of my blog, I knew I wanted to be able to deploy quickly and efficiently as well as have complete control over all aspects of my server, including caching, routing and cost.  For these reasons I knew migrating away from Heroku was unavoidable, anoter upside of that is I have total control over my data as well :) Just to be clear, I was previously using the free version of Heroku (thanks Heroku) so I have nothing bad to say about them, I just knew I could get a lot more bang for my buck elsewhere. I had heard quite the murmor about [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=7349251230a0) (full disclosure I'm an affiliate, non affiliate link here - [Digital Ocean](http://www.digitalocean.com)) and the $5 price point really helped make the decision a no-brainer, ironically enough they did have a short outage while I was writing this tutorial, but they are very quick to respond and notify customers of problems very quickly.

My full time job involves deploying a lot of large scale and complex Rails applications, which typically consists of a combination of various scripts being triggered through [Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano).  Capistrano is fantastic, but overall felt a bit too heavy handed for what I was doing, essentially deploying static files to a remote server.  Enter [Mina](http://nadarei.co/mina/) (side note, I really have no idea how I should pronounce Mina.  "Minna" or maybe "Mine-a"), a super fast, lightweight and powerful deployment utility.  Check out this logo:

</div>

That logo alone was reason enough for me to give it a shot, it looks like a flippin' super villains chest piece.  Other promising aspects of Mina included:

- Only ONE SSH session per deploy, compared to one session per COMMAND on Capistrano
- Built on top of the already familiar Rake
- Safe and bloody fast

Convinced yet?  I certainly am, that's why I'm writing this tutorial.  Creating an account with Digital Ocean is dead simple,  make sure you [setup and add your SSH key](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2) to allow for easier deployments. It's slightly outside the scope of this tutorial, so read the D.O. guide if you are having trouble.  

##Notes before we begin
I much prefer to manage my ruby versions using [RVM](http://rvm.io/), although that isn't a requirement for this to work by any means, but I will be using it in this guide.  I'm also not going to go too much into using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), as I'm going to assume you already have an idea of how it works, or possibly are already using it.  Also might be worth noting that my client machine is a MacBook Air running the latest OSX 10.8.4, although there is absolutely no reason it wouldn't work anywhere.  My Digital Ocean droplet is running Ubuntu 12-04.

##Configure your Jekyll blog to use mina
As noted before, I use RVM and Gemfile's to simplify my projects and gem management.  Here is the `Gemfile` for my Jekyll blog:

{% prism ruby %}
#Gemfile
source :rubygems
gem "rake"                # actually not need for heroku but for the provided Rakefile
gem "activesupport", "~> 3.2.11"
gem "flickraw", "~> 0.9.6"
gem "RedCloth"            # if you want to use the Textile Markup Language
gem "redcarpet"
gem "jekyll", "1.0.3" # we need at least this version so jekyll will use Ruby 1.9.2
gem "pygmentize", "~> 0.0.3"
gem "mina", "0.3.0"
{% endprism %}

The latest version of mina as of writing is "0.3.0".  To "minatize" our blog, make sure you bundle to install the gems, then run `bundle exec mina init`. This will create a ./config/deploy.rb file.  This is simply a Rake file with tasks for mina to run.  Let's look at a boilerplate mina file:

{% prism ruby %}
require 'mina/bundler'
require 'mina/rails'
require 'mina/git'
# require 'mina/rbenv'  # for rbenv support. (http://rbenv.org)
# require 'mina/rvm'    # for rvm support. (http://rvm.io)

# Basic settings:
#   domain       - The hostname to SSH to.
#   deploy_to    - Path to deploy into.
#   repository   - Git repo to clone from. (needed by mina/git)
#   branch       - Branch name to deploy. (needed by mina/git)

set :domain, 'foobar.com'
set :deploy_to, '/var/www/foobar.com'
set :repository, 'git://...'
set :branch, 'master'

# Manually create these paths in shared/ (eg: shared/config/database.yml) in your server.
# They will be linked in the 'deploy:link_shared_paths' step.
set :shared_paths, ['config/database.yml', 'log']

# Optional settings:
#   set :user, 'foobar'    # Username in the server to SSH to.
#   set :port, '30000'     # SSH port number.

# This task is the environment that is loaded for most commands, such as
# `mina deploy` or `mina rake`.
task :environment do
  # If you're using rbenv, use this to load the rbenv environment.
  # Be sure to commit your .rbenv-version to your repository.
  # invoke :'rbenv:load'

  # For those using RVM, use this to load an RVM version@gemset.
  # invoke :'rvm:use[ruby-1.9.3-p125@default]'
end

# Put any custom mkdir's in here for when `mina setup` is ran.
# For Rails apps, we'll make some of the shared paths that are shared between
# all releases.
task :setup => :environment do
  queue! %[mkdir -p "#{deploy_to}/shared/log"]
  queue! %[chmod g+rx,u+rwx "#{deploy_to}/shared/log"]

  queue! %[mkdir -p "#{deploy_to}/shared/config"]
  queue! %[chmod g+rx,u+rwx "#{deploy_to}/shared/config"]

  queue! %[touch "#{deploy_to}/shared/config/database.yml"]
  queue  %[echo "-----> Be sure to edit 'shared/config/database.yml'."]
end

desc "Deploys the current version to the server."
task :deploy => :environment do
  deploy do
    # Put things that will set up an empty directory into a fully set-up
    # instance of your project.
    invoke :'git:clone'
    invoke :'deploy:link_shared_paths'
    invoke :'bundle:install'
    invoke :'rails:db_migrate'
    invoke :'rails:assets_precompile'

    to :launch do
      queue "touch #{deploy_to}/tmp/restart.txt"
    end
  end
end
